## Family Business Management System - Frontend Overview
The Family Business Management System (Frontend) provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the backend system. Built with React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Ant Design (antd), this dashboard allows users (admins and employees) to manage business operations, visualize data, and interact with customers, transactions, and employee information.

## Technologies Used:
- React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- Ant Design (antd): A design system for enterprise-level products.
- Recharts: Data visualization library used for displaying interactive charts.

Note: This frontend is still under development, and several features are incomplete or in a "broken" state. However, the dashboard page has been partially implemented and provides a glimpse into the overall design and structure.

The dashboard includes data visualizations built using Recharts, which display financial trends, customer data, and other business metrics.

## Current Features (in Progress)
- Dashboard page with data visualizations (line charts, pie charts).
- Authentication (though not fully integrated with backend at this stage).
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

## Whatâ€™s Missing / In Progress:
- Business logic integration (still under development).
- Data fetching and interaction with backend API.
- Additional pages and components (currently just the dashboard).

## Future Plans
- Complete the integration with the backend API for real-time data fetching.
- Refine the frontend structure and implement additional pages (e.g., customer management, transaction history).
- Improve UI/UX, especially for the admin interface.
